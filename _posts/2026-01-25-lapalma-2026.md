## Introduction

In the late summer of 2023, we decided to venture upon the mountains and valleys of Kyrgyzstan. Our mission was to retrace the steps of the horse lords, to find the mystical lake of Ala-kul.

## Trail

This section contains a description of our chosen route, along with an interactive map of the trail. Would like to improve this by giving some stats (distance, expected days) as well as an elevation profile.
