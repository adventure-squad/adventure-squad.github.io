## Introduction

One of the smaller western Canary islands, La Palma is famed for its volcanic activity and lush greenery. Steep mountains and a central volcanic crater have incited unique climate, as well as a wider array of biomes than one might expect for an island of its size.

Our planned route across the volcanic spine of the island was scheduled to take approximately 4-5 days, which we planned to supplement with 2 additional days along the GR130 to take us back to Santa Cruz. The bulk of the route would have us skirting the Caldera de Taburiente, a 9km wide volcanic crater featuring steep drops down to its central valley.

## Trail

The traditional direction to walk the GR131 starts at the southern tip of the island, ending in the west. Our group chose instead to flip the route due to concerns about having to descend 2400m on the final day, though this did mean turning that into a brutal ascent with which to start.

With a total distance just under 100km, we had hoped to be able to complete the journey in 6-7 days, camping along the way.

#### Accomodation

Wildcamping is technically not allowed on most of the Canary islands, but largely tolerated if you stick to leave-no-trace. You will see early trail runners at or before sunrise however, so it's advisable to be packed up by dawn. For official campsites, you will require a permit that you need to register for beforehand.

We didn't see a huge amount of great camping spots along the way--many areas are quite rocky, steep, and exposed to wind. The wind especially can be a problem since the base temperature is 3-4C in January. Our campsites are marked on the trail map below.

There is a single refuge building along the way, with running water and wooden bunks to sleep on. It's a small stone house with a bedroom and basic living area. 




## Preparation

This section described how we prepared for the trip. Perhaps we can share some of the spreadsheets that we used to determine the route, equipment, etc.

### Equipment

We didn't bring any specialist gear for this trip, but did need to pack for colder weather than expected. Even with several additional layers, nights were cold with stern mountain winds making it feel like <0C. Victor kindly donated some chemical hand warmers to myself and Glenn, which, when creatively placed, provided some relief.

### Water

Moreso than on previous trips, water was a point of worry on La Palma. There aren't any accessible natural sources of fresh water in the mountains, so you're largely dependent on public taps. We identified 4 possible water points on the route, and made sure to plan our days around being able to access water at least once daily. The water is usually non-potable, our group prefers using Aquatab purification tablets to purify.

We usually topped up with 3L at each water point, which ended up being more than enough. We verified the first three water points as being fully operational as of Jan 2026--we didn't need to use the fourth one.

### Food

Given that we had planned to resupply in Los Canarios, we brought along enough food for 4-5 days. Breakfast was an oat mix that we had prepared at home (just add boiling water and bonus fruit). It was our first time bringing a home-made variant of our favourite breakfast MRE, deemed a success to be brought for future trips.

For lunch, we ate bread with ham/cheese the first days, followed by MREs on days 3-4. Due to a linguistic cock-up at the supermarket I (bart) ended up accidentally buying the absolute lamborghini of spanish ham that cost 90 EUR/kg (it was delicious).

Dinner consisted of MREs, we decided not to try to cook this time around, and pack as light as possible given the unknowns and short planning time.

## Journey
 
The squad assembled on T-1 at Tenerife Sud airport (TFS), ready to make for the coast and take the ferry to La Palma. After a quick stop in Los Cristianos to pick up camping gas (screw variant) we were firmly asea. The mood was celebratory, we had made it!
