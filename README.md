## How to:

### Add a new blog post:

1. In the _posts folder, add a new .md file with your post content. (Easiest way is to copy an existing one and just that as a template.
2. Posts are written in markdown. There are a few custom features included such as embedded gpx maps and image galleries, whose implementation is described below. [This is a good markdown guide](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/markdown/)
3. There are a lot of editors that allow markdown editing with live preview. VSCode or Notepad++ are good options.
4. Once you're done editing a new post, you can commit and push it to the main branch. The site will automatically rebuild and deploy it after a few minutes.
